#Data-Processing-and-Exploring-Diabetes-Indicators-in-Women-PIMA-Indian-Diabetes-Dataset-Analysis

This project aims to utilize the PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset to discover critical markers of diabetes among female patients. Diabetes is a serious health issue that has to be identified and treated early. The dataset contains a binary goal variable "Outcome" (0 for no diabetes, 1 for diabetes), along with demographic and health-related information specific to female patients. The analysis was conducted using Jupyter Notebook with Python, leveraging libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, and seaborn.

#Key Steps and Tools Used:

Data Cleaning: Processed the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data consistency using pandas.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Utilized numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn to visualize data distributions, correlations, and identify potential predictors of diabetes.

Visualization: Created histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices to explore relationships between variables.

Insights: Analyzed data patterns and correlations to identify potential risk factors contributing to diabetes among women.
